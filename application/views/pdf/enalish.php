    <p>Bangladesh has the potential to become a hub for manufacturing electric vehicles (EV) as industries for the production of components such as batteries and tyres have already been established while the growing population assures market viability. </p>
        <img src="<?php echo base_url()?>/images/bangla/2.jpg">
        <p>"EV needs less components than fossil fuel vehicles while it is easy to set up manufacturing and assembling plants," said Munawar Misbah Moin, president of the Accumulators Battery Manufacturers and Exporters Association of Bangladesh.</p>

        وOnly Tk 300 crore to Tk 500 crore is needed to establish an EV assembling and manufacturing plant while the backward linkage industries are growing rapidly, including the light engineering sector which supplies components, he said.

    The EV industry will enable environment protection through the use of green energy, create jobs and revolutionise the mass transportation system, said Moin.

There are around 20 lakh battery-run three-wheelers around the country enabling moving short distance in rural and semi-urban areas at low cost and larger EV will do the same for inter-district commuting, he said.
